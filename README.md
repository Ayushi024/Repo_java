Ques2:Write a program to implement a command line calculator.
Ques3:Write a program to accept 10 student’s marks in an array, arrange it into ascending order, convert into the following grades and print marks and grades in the tabular form.
         Between 40 and 50 : PASS 
         Between 51 and 75 : MERIT 
          and above : DISTINCTION
Ques 4:WAP to Take input as DD MM YYYY(04 08 2021) in command line and calculatenumber of days since 1 January 1970.
Ques5:WAP to print increasing right angle tringle        
Ques6:Write a program to accept three digits (i.e. 0 - 9) and print all its possible combinations.
(For example if the three digits are 1, 2, 3 than all possible combinations are : 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321.)
Ques7:Write a Java Program to accept 10 numbers in an array and compute the square of each number. Print the sum of these numbers.
Ques8:Write a program to input a number of a month (1 - 12) and print its equivalent name of the month.( e.g 1 to Jan, 2 to Feb. 12 to Dec.)
Ques9:Write a program to find the sum of all integers greater than 40 and less than 250 that are divisible by 5.
Ques 10:.Write a Java program to show that private member of a super class cannot be accessed from derived classes?
Ques11:Write a program in Java to create a Player class. Inherit the classes Cricket_Player,
Football _Player and Hockey_ Player from Playerclass.
Ques 12:Write a class Worker and derive classes DailyWorker and SalariedWorker from it. Ever worker has a name and a salary rate. Write method ComPay (int hours) to compute the week pay of every worker. A Daily Worker is paid on the basis of the number of days he/she works. The Salaried Worker gets paid the wage for 40 hours a week no matter what the actual hours are. Test this program to calculate the pay of workers. You are expected to use the concept of polymorphism to write this program?
Ques13:Consider the trunk calls of a telephone exchange. A trunk call can be ordinary, urgent or lightning. The charges depend on the duration and the type of the call. Write a program using the concept of polymorphism in Java to calculate the charges
Ques 14:Design a class employee of an organization. An employee has a name, empid, and salary  .Write the default constructor, a constructor with parameters (name, empid, and salary) and methods to return name and salary. Also write a method increase Salary that raises the employee’s salary by a certain user specified percentage. Derive a subclass Manager from employee. Add an instance variable named department to the manager class. Supply a test program that uses theses classes and methods.
